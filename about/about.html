                    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
                    <h1>We exist to help creators <br> own their audience.</h1>
                    <h2>We believe that social platforms are taking advantage of creators. <br> We want to change that and help creators fight back. </h2>
                </div>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>
                        Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's
                        land. While social platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience,
                        your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text
                        message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight,
                        millions of creative people almost lost their careers. <br>
                        <br>
                        If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer
                        favours you, are you prepared? <br>
                        <br>
                        If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable
                        distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you
                        build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These
                        distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when
                        you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your
                        content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your
                        acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your
                        audience. <br>
                        <br>
                        We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional
                        solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring
                        someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you
                        get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text
                        message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it
                        automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We
                        believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build
                        your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is
                        share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest. <br>
                        <br>
                        You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks
                        to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your
                        content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours. <br>
                        <br>
                        For too long, social platforms have taken advantage of creators. Fight back and
                        build an audience that you own. <br>
